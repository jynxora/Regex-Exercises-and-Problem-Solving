# RegexOne Practice Log

## Overview
Today spent dedicated hours to practice **regular expressions** using [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/).

The goal:
- Build stronger pattern-matching skills
- Improve ability to craft **precise YARA rules**
- Lay groundwork for efficient detection engineering in DFIR and cybersecurity contexts

### Key Patterns Learned
| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `\d` | Match any digit |
| `\w` | Match any alphanumeric |
| `[abc]` | Match specific letters |
| `[^abc]` | Match anything except a, b, c |
| `{m,n}` | Match between m and n repetitions |
| `(abc|def)` | Match either abc or def |
| `^pattern$` | Match entire line exactly |

## Takeaways
- Regex is **foundational** to detection engineering.
- Many YARA rules can be elevated by replacing literal strings with **regex-based conditions**.
- Escaping matters (`\.` vs `.`) â€” a single missing backslash can change everything.
- Regex strengthens both **defensive filtering** and **offensive payload crafting**.
